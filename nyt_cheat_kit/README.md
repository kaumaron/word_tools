# NYT Cheat Kit

This set of code is a silly way of searching the web for the answers.

It's somewhat an exercise in web scraping but also a response to some people 
saying the [../word_search/word_search.py](word search tool) is cheating even 
though the intended use there is educational, it's absolutely possible that it 
can be used to cheat. So, if someone is inclined to use it to cheat, they can 
just use this cheat kit.
